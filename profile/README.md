🍿 **Project Description** <br>
Having such a varied user base and inventory brings in new challenges. One of the biggest challenges that Traveloka faces is deciphering the appropriate order in which hotels should be displayed for a user when searching on our platform. Abdool et al., in their paper, Managing Diversity in Airbnb Search, state that the probability of the user clicking on a particular hotel and eventually booking it decays as the user goes down the list of hotels displayed to the user. As a result, relevant ordering of these hotels for our users directly impacts the business Traveloka brings in for its partners. We take the challenge by making a new approach to enhance hotel recommendations using a wide and deep learning network model to strike the right balance between memorization and generalization. With such a vast and varied user base, we acknowledged that a one-size-fits-all solution would not have worked to cater to the varying demand and supply. There was a need to provide our users with a more personalized experience on the hotel search page.
